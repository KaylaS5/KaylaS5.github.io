<h3>Now, this isn't a how-to website, this is just me trying new things while i go on about html.</h3>
<h2><u>Places I want to go:</u></h2>
<br>
<p>One place i'd like to go to is Hawaii. I always thought Hawaii was such a beautiful place with all the beaches and trees. Here's a picture:</p>

<p class="groove">another place i'd like to go is a beach with black sand.</p>
<img style="border:1px dashed darkslateblue;" src="KaylaS5.github.io/download.jpg" alt="Beach with black sand."
<br>
<p>i'm not big on going to new places, it's not on my bucket list to travel but if it was offered i'd agree and go.</p>
<br>
<h3>Another thing I love love love is giraffes!</h3>
<P class="dotted dashed solid double"><u>I've always loved giraffes, ever since i was young i always found the fascinating</u></P>
<p>One thing that stuck out to me about giraffes is the way they fight.</p>

<h3>Now onto my journey with html</h3>
<p>One thing I know for sure is that html takes time and patience, lots of trial and error will occur. You have to be willing to make sure you fix those errors and do whatever you can to achieve your goal. Now as you go one into html you're going to realize, compared to what you started with and what you have now is boring. You're going to go back and upgrade to something better, a better design. This takes time to learn and discover new ideas.</p>
