<h3>Now, this isn't a how-to website, this is just me trying new things while i go on about html.</h3>
<h2><u>Places I want to go:</u></h2>
<br>
<p>One place i'd like to go to is Hawaii. I always thought Hawaii was such a beautiful place with all the beaches and trees. Here's a picture:</p>

<br>
<p class="groove">another place i'd like to go is a beach with black sand.</p>
<img style="border:1px dashed darkslateblue;" src="KaylaS5.github.io/download.jpg" alt="Beach with black sand."
<br>
<p>i'm not big on going to new places, it's not on my bucket list to travel but if it was offered i'd agree and go.</p>
<br>
<h3>Another thing I love love love is giraffes!</h3>
<P class="dotted dashed solid double"><u>I've always loved giraffes, ever since i was young i always found the fascinating</u></P>
<p>One thing that stuck out to me about giraffes is the way they fight.</p>

<h3>Now onto my journey with html:</h3>
<p>One thing I know for sure is that html takes time and patience, lots of trial and error will occur. You have to be willing to make sure you fix those errors and do whatever you can to achieve your goal. Now as you go one into html you're going to realize, compared to what you started with and what you have now is boring. You're going to go back and upgrade to something better, a better design. This takes time to learn and discover new ideas.</p>
<p>My journey with html is still ungoing and will continue.</p>
<p>usually what happens when you look up a picture that has html coding into it you immediately become intimidated. Honestly it's not like that if you just learn even the basics of it. Soon you'll get an inside image of what that code looks like.</p>
<p>Another really cool thing is the different types of things you could do with html. For example, when you learn html you could learn how a webpage works, you could also create your own just like how i did here using the following websites to help me:</p>
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">This is one of the websites i used to help me learn html.</a>
<a href="https://github.com/">This is the website i used to create my coding and publish a website.</a>
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/webpage">Now this is the website i used to test my coding to make sure what i was putting was correct.</a>
<p>If you want to save your progress for github and khanacademy you'll have to create an account. For github you'll have to create one regardless but for khan academy it really doesn't matter.</p>

    p. outset {border-style: outset;}
</style>
<p class="outset">You could create different types of borders just like how you've seen through out my page.</p>
</style>
    <p class="outset">This is hsjkash</p>
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="400" height="100" style="border:1px solid #2b3856;"></canvas>

<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.font = "30px Arial";
ctx.strokeText("You could do this too ( :",10,50);
</script>
