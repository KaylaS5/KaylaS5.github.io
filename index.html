        <title>HTML from a starter</title>
    </head>
    <body style='background-color:#ADD8E6'>

<p> If you are a starter in html this is a page where you can go through and read how i've done html and my journey.</p>
    </body>
    <br>
    <p>One thing that has been most difficult for me is trying to get the hang of html. Putting designs and boxes, pictures and all of that stuff can be hard.</p>
    <br>
    <p style= "color:blue;">Trying to get this was harder because i didn't know any info about this </p>
    <br>
    <div style= "background-color:Black; color:orange; padding: 20px;">Also something like this can be even harder to do for beginners because it has more information that needs to be added to it.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p> You can demonstrate different things like <span style="color:red;">Important</span> Messages </p>
<br>
<p>There are also different ways to do layouts. Like for example if you wanted to write something about yourself but you wanted it
to be fancy you can do so by doing what below;</p>
    <body>
        <div id="header">
            <h2>About me</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="nav">
            My favorite animal<br>
            My favorite color<br>
            Where I want to travel
        </div>
        <div id="section">
            <h3>My favorite animal</h3>
            <p> My favorite animal is a giraffe, i've always loved everything about giraffes. How they're weird but in sort of a unique way.
            <h4>My favorite color</h4>
            <p>My favorite color is blue, it wasn't always like that. I use to like pink when i was younger but as i grew older i grew a fascination for the color blue.</p>
            <h4>Where i want to travel</h4>
            <p> I was never big on the whole traveling the world type of person but i do want to visit a few places. I want to visit somewhere where there's lots of snow during the winter but very warm during the summer. I also want to go some where like Ireland or England to live in, for the different environments.</p>
        </div>
    <div style="color:blue;" id="footer">
        About me.
    </div>
    </body>
    <br>
        <body style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;">
    <h3> <u>My Difficulties:</u></h3>

<p style="color:purple;"> One thing that's made this difficult is trying to memorize all of the different types of code. One way to learn how to do this is basically read over the tutorial link and just go from there. It's best to try it out then ask questions so you know what you need to learn rather than misc information. </p>
<br>
<h4> <u>How i chose to solve this difficulty</u></h4>
<br>
<p> One way I sort of solved this issue is by just repeating my steps. As i kept doing this over and over I started nto get the hang of it. One thing i've learned so far is that html takes time and patience.</p>
</body>
<body style="font-family:Impact;">
    <p style="color:#FF00FF"> I realize how this page is becoming more and more disorganized but this is sort of like a tester for me. To test out the different types of code i'm trying to learn. Sort of like a trial and error.
